# Laptop Price Prediction
This is the project i did in Jupyter Notebook (Python).

## Problem Statement

With the growing variety of laptop models and specifications available in the market, consumers often struggle to make informed purchasing decisions based on price. 
This project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates laptop prices based on various features such as RAM, weight, brand, and operating system.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to create a model that predicts laptop prices, providing valuable insights
to consumers and retailers alike. This model will help consumers make informed choices and assist retailers in setting competitive prices.

## Importance

- Consumer Empowerment: Accurate price predictions enable consumers to understand the market better and avoid overpaying for laptops.
- Business Strategy: Retailers can utilize pricing models to optimize their pricing strategies, manage inventory efficiently, and improve customer satisfaction.
- Market Insights: Understanding the factors influencing laptop prices can help manufacturers and marketers position their products more effectively.
  
## Objectives

- Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of laptops, including various specifications and prices.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, detecting outliers, and scaling features.
- Model Development: Train and evaluate multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest) to find the best-performing one.
- Model Evaluation: Compare the models based on performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error.
- Insights Generation: Analyze the model outcomes to derive key insights regarding laptop pricing trends.
  
## Steps Involved

### Data Collection:

Gather data from various sources, such as online retailers and databases. Ensure that the dataset includes relevant features like RAM, weight, brand, and price.

### Data Preprocessing:

- Handling Missing Values: Identify and fill in or remove missing data to maintain dataset integrity.
- Outlier Detection: Use statistical methods and visualizations to identify and manage outliers that may skew results.
- Feature Encoding: Convert categorical features into numerical formats suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- Data Normalization: Scale features using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity across different scales.
  
### Model Development:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20) using train_test_split().
Fit various regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to the training data.

### Model Evaluation:

Assess model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.

### Insights Generation:

Analyze model results to identify trends and correlations between features (e.g., RAM vs. price) and generate actionable insights.

## Visuals and Key Insights

### Scatter Plot of RAM vs. Price:

Shows a positive correlation between RAM and laptop prices, with most laptops clustering around lower RAM values.

### Histogram of Weight Distribution:

Reveals common weight categories, indicating the prevalence of certain laptop types (e.g., ultrabooks vs. gaming laptops).

### Bar Chart of Laptop Brands:

Displays the frequency of laptops from various brands, highlighting market representation.

### Average Prices by Operating System:

Illustrates price variations across different operating systems, informing consumers about cost differences.

### Correlation Matrix:

Summarizes pairwise correlations among features, indicating the relationships and potential multicollinearity between them.

## Technical Skills
